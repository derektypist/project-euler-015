# Project Euler 015 - Lattice Paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

The aim is to find the number of such routes through a given gridsize (e.g. 20x20), using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
